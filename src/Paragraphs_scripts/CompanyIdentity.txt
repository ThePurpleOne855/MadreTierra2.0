Madre Tierra is a family-owned and operated brand of fine cigars, all handmade in Tamboril, Dominican Republic. Our expertly blended cigars combine the finest tobaccos from Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, and we proudly manage the entire process from seed to smoke.

Blending cigars since 1982, Madre Tierra was recently introduced to the U.S. market by owners Juanna De La Cruz, John Deans, and Jacob Senior.
