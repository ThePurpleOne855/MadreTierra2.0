Madre Tierra currently produces 10 unique Toro (6x52) blends: Connecticut, Rosado, Habano, San Andrés, Candela, La Fuma, Pennsylvania Broadleaf, Cameroon, Sumatra, and Corojo.

Each cigar offers a distinct and memorable flavor profile, yet remains more approachable than many other cigars from the region, making it enjoyable for both seasoned aficionados and newcomers alike.
